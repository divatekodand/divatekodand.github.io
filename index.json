Also, as a result of my internship, I gained knowledge about end-to-end perception, tracking, prediction and motion planning pipeline for autonomous vehicles. Additionally, I can fluently program in C, C++ and Python. Further, I have experience using Deep Learning frameworks (Tensorflow and Pytorch).\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://divatekodand.github.io/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"I am a graduate student in the Department of Computer Science at University of Wisconsin-Madison looking for full time opportunities starting summer 2020.
